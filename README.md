*Oh jeez.*

*Is this actually a thing now? Look for me hiding in the bedroom later.*

So this is an open source project aimed at using technology to bring empathy and education to the internet. Basically, fix America with the internet that is hurting her now. 

Wait, wait... politics and the internet? ... What I'm hearing a lot is, that's a bad idea.

In fact, everyone from President Obama to your mom tells you to get off the internet. "Go outside, talk to real people." Two problems with that: 

1. People online are real people
2. Nobody is getting offline any time soon

We literally have the internet in our kitchen appliances now. As a child of the early 80s can tell you, if "Get off the computer" didn't work when all we had was dial-up, it isn't gonna work ever, *especially* when it's everywhere around us. 

So! Here we are on the internet. You know who else never got off the internet? The forum trolls. The 4channers. The Westboro Baptist Church which [registered "godhatesfags.com"](https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=godhatesfags.com) way back in 1997. Some people have been arguing this same group of people online for two decades. We had flame wars. We had forum rules. **We had the banhammer.**

Once computers entered homes and internet loaded on cellphones, though, it got popular. Our grandmothers are on the internet. Our coworkers. People who always say, "I'm not a computer person." Innocents who didn't know what "Don't feel the trolls" meant and had no idea how to tell a suspicious website from the real thing. And that brings me to the second piece of bad advice we perhaps shouldn't have taken:
